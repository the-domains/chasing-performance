  Science works best when it is open. The sharing of research results, the free
  circulation of knowledge, and transparency in methodology are key tenets to
  the scientific method. This openness makes science a natural environment for
  collaboration. By pooling together resources, brainpower and complementary
  expertise, collaborative research ensures that global societal challenges can
  be tackled.
